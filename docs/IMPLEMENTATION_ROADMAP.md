## Dependencies and Blocking Relationships

### Critical Path Dependencies
- **M1 → M2**: Foundation infrastructure required before any UI development
- **M2 → M3**: Basic functionality needed before enhanced features
- **M3 → M4**: Core UX established before mobile-specific features

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **M4 & M5**: Mobile features and power user features can be developed in parallel
- **M6 Polish**: Can begin during M5 for non-blocking items like design system

### Risk Mitigation
- **API Changes**: Foundation in M1 isolates API changes from UI layers
- **Platform Issues**: Mobile features in M4 isolated from core functionality
- **Performance**: Early testing in M3 prevents major rework in M6
