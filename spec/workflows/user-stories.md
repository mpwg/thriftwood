## Workflow Integration Patterns

### Cross-Service Workflows
Many user workflows span multiple services and require coordination:

1. **Content Discovery → Addition → Download Monitoring**
   - Search unified results → Add to appropriate service → Monitor download progress

2. **Issue Resolution → Alternative Search → Manual Addition**
   - Failed download detection → Alternative release search → Manual quality selection

3. **Library Management → Statistics → Optimization**
   - Library health check → Performance analysis → Settings optimization

### Error Handling Workflows
Consistent error handling across all user stories:

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Features continue working with reduced functionality
2. **Clear Error Messages**: User-friendly explanations with actionable next steps
3. **Recovery Options**: Multiple paths to resolve issues
4. **Help Integration**: Contextual help and documentation links

### Data Synchronization Workflows
Cross-device and offline synchronization patterns:

1. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately with server confirmation
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Clear strategies for handling sync conflicts
3. **Incremental Sync**: Only sync changed data to minimize bandwidth
4. **Background Sync**: Automatic synchronization without user intervention

This comprehensive collection of user stories and workflows provides the foundation for implementing a user-centered media management application that addresses real-world use cases while maintaining technical excellence and platform consistency.
